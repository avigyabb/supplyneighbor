<br/><br/>
<h3>Claims of Copyright Infringement.</h3> The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Supply Neighbor a notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to it. If you believe, in good faith, that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send Supply Neighbor a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices should be sent to: Site and/or Services Site Administrator, Supply Neighbor, Valencia, CA

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.

This, together with all policies referred to herein, is the entire Agreement between you and Supply Neighbor relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and Supply Neighbor relating to such subject matter. Notices to you may be made via posting to the Site or by e-mail in our sole discretion. Supply Neighbor will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.
